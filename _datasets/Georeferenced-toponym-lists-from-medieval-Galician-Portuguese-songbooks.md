### Notes
These are georeferenced toponym lists originally created by projet [Littera](https://cantigas.fcsh.unl.pt/) database. According to the project's website, the database includes "all the 'cantigas' (songs) contained in the medieval Galician-Portuguese 'Cancioneiros' (songbooks), the manuscripts' images and also the music (either medieval or the contemporary versions or original compositions which take the texts of medieval songs as a starting point).The DB also includes brief information about all the authors included in it, of the characters and places mentioned in the songs, as well as the "Arte de Trovar", the little poetic treaty on troubadours’ art that opens the “Cancioneiro” of the Portugal National Library."

No date and copyright info available for the map but according to [Project Littera - Presentation](https://cantigas.fcsh.unl.pt/apresentacao.asp), the project is from 2011.

Dataset includes several geojson files (original downloads from  [Mapa das Cantigas Medievais Galego-Portuguesas(Map of Cantigas)](http://u.osmfr.org/m/551707/),) and a GeoPackage with all layers.
