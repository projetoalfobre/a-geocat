<h2 >About us</h2>
<p>A-GeoCat (Alfobre GeoData Catalog) is an open geospatial data catalog developed and maintained by the <a href="http://alfobre.com" target="_blank">Alfobre</a> team. Alfobre is portuguese for seedbed but it's also a collective devoted to the creation and development of projects, strategies and products in the Heritage field.</p>
